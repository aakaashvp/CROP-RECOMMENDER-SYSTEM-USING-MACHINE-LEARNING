# CROP-RECOMMENDER-SYSTEM-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

A farmer’s decision about which crop to grow is generally clouded by his intuition and other irrelevant factors like making instant profits, lack of awareness about market demand, overestimating a soil’s potential to support a particular crop, and so on. A very misguided decision on the part of the farmer could place a significant strain on his family’s financial condition. Perhaps this could be one of the many reasons contributing to the countless suicide cases of farmers that we hear from media on a daily basis.  In a country like India, where agriculture and related sectors contribute to approximately 20.4 percent of its Gross Value Added (GVA) [2], such an erroneous judgment would have negative implications on not just the farmer’s family, but the entire economy of a region. 
For this reason, we have identified a farmer’s dilemma about which crop to grow during a particular season, as a very grave one. The need of the hour is to design a system that could provide predictive insights to the Indian farmers, thereby helping them make an informed decision about which crop to grow. With this in mind, we propose a system, an intelligent system that would consider environmental parameters (temperature, rainfall, geographical location in terms of state) and soil characteristics (pH value, soil type and nutrients concentration) before recommending the most suitable crop to the user


## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
                   
We propose an Intelligent Crop Recommendation system- which takes into consideration all the appropriate parameters, including temperature, rainfall, location and soil condition, to predict crop suitability. This system is fundamentally concerned with performing the primary function of Agro Consultant, which is, providing crop recommendations to farmers algorithms. We also provide the profit analysis on crops grown in different states which gives the user an easy and reliable insight to decide and plan the crops.

## Features

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
This system helps the farmer to choose the right crop by providing insights that ordinary farmers don’t keep track of thereby decreasing the chances of crop failure and increasing productivity. It also prevents them from incurring losses. The system can be extended to the web and can be accessed by millions of farmers across the country.We could achieve an accuracy of 89.88 percent from the neural network and an accuracy of 88.26 percent from the linear regression model
Further development is to integrate the crop recommendation system with another subsystem, yield predictor that would also provide the farmer an estimate of production if he plants the recommended crops.
